# Order Service

## Overview

Event-sourced gRPC service handling the complete order lifecycle across four aggregate types. Uses saga orchestration for multi-step fulfillment, CQRS with separate read models, transactional outbox for Kafka publishing, and Redis distributed locking for concurrent saga protection.

## Architecture (Event Sourcing + CQRS + Saga)

- **Api/** — gRPC services (`OrderGrpcService`, `B2BOrderGrpcService`, `RecurringOrderGrpcService`), validators, Program.cs
- **Application/** — Commands, Queries, Sagas (with steps and event handlers), Consumers, DTOs, `ApplicationModule.cs`
- **Domain/** — Aggregate roots (Order, B2BOrder, RequestReturn), Value Objects (OrderStatus, Money, Address, strongly-typed IDs), Domain Events, Services (ReturnPolicyService), Exceptions
- **Infrastructure/** — Event store, Saga repository, Read repositories, Outbox, Kafka messaging, Background services, Redis locking, Region affinity, Serialization, `InfrastructureModule.cs`
- **Protos/** — Separate class library

## Tech Stack

- .NET 8, gRPC
- PostgreSQL + EF Core 8 (event store + read models in separate DbContexts)
- Kafka: Confluent.Kafka (producer + consumer)
- Redis (StackExchange.Redis) for saga distributed locking
- MediatR (command/query dispatch)
- FluentValidation
- OpenTelemetry (Jaeger exporter)
- Testing: NUnit + NSubstitute (unit), xUnit + Testcontainers (integration/E2E)

## Event Sourcing

- **Write**: Aggregate raises domain events → `EventStoreRepository.SaveEventsAsync()` saves to DomainEvents table with version increment
- **Read**: Load events by AggregateId → deserialize by type registry → replay `Apply()` methods on aggregate
- **Snapshots**: Taken every N events (50 for Order, 20 for B2B Quote) → reconstruct from snapshot + events after snapshot
- **Concurrency**: Version-based optimistic concurrency — mismatch throws `ConcurrencyConflictException`
- **Persistence**: `OrderPersistenceService` wraps event save + outbox write in single transaction

## Aggregates & State Machines

### Order (standard)
- Pending → Paid → Approved → Completed | Cancelled
- Methods: `Create()`, `Pay()`, `Approve()`, `Complete()`, `Cancel()`, `AssignTracking()`, `RevertTrackingAssignment()`

### B2BOrder (living quote)
- Draft → Finalized | Cancelled
- Long-lived (days/weeks), low snapshot threshold (20 events due to many draft edits)
- Methods: `Start()`, `AddItem()`, `RemoveItem()`, `ChangeItemQuantity()`, `AdjustItemPrice()`, `ApplyDiscount()`, `AddComment()`, `Finalize()`, `Cancel()`
- Finalization creates a child standard Order

### Recurring Order
- Schedule-based; `RecurringOrderSchedulerService` polls due orders every 60s
- Executes via standard order creation flow

### Return Request
- Pending → Received → Refunded → Completed
- ReturnSaga handles multi-day physical delivery wait

## Saga Orchestration

### SagaBase (Generic Orchestrator)
- `ExecuteAsync()`: Runs steps sequentially, handles WaitForEvent/Fail
- `ResumeFromStepAsync()`: Skips completed steps, re-runs the specified step
- `CompensateAsync()`: Reverses steps in order (last completed → first)
- Saga timeout: 5 min total (per-saga, not per-step)
- States: Running → Completed | WaitingForEvent | Failed | TimedOut | FailedToCompensate

### OrderSaga Steps (8 steps)
0. **CancelOrderOnFailureStep** — no-op on execute; compensation cancels order
1. **ReserveInventoryStep** — calls InventoryGateway.ReserveAsync()
2. **CapturePaymentStep** — branches by PaymentIntentId presence:
   - B2C pre-auth: `CaptureAsync(paymentIntentId)` → immediate result
   - Backend-initiated (B2B/COD/BNPL): `ProcessPaymentAsync()` → Succeeded/Pending/RequiresAction/Failed
   - DeadlineExceeded → Uncertain + WaitForEvent (NOT immediate failure)
   - Unavailable → Fail → compensation
3. **AwaitPaymentConfirmationStep** — checks PaymentStatus; WaitForEvent if Pending/Uncertain
4. **UpdateOrderStatusStep** — confirm inventory, set order to Paid
5. **CreateShipmentStep** — create shipment, assign tracking
6. **CompleteOrderStep** — approve + complete order
7. **SendConfirmationEmailStep** — send email (3 retries; failure doesn't fail saga)

### ReturnSaga Steps (6 steps)
- ValidateReturnRequest → AwaitReturnShipment (waits days) → ConfirmReceived → ProcessRefund → UpdateAccounting → CompleteReturn

### Saga Event Handlers
- **Creation**: `OrderCreatedEventHandler` — starts saga on OrderCreatedEvent from Kafka
- **Continuation**: `PaymentSucceededEventHandler`/`PaymentFailedEventHandler` — resumes paused saga with Redis lock

### Redis Saga Locking
- Key: `saga-lock:OrderSaga:{correlationId}`
- Acquire: SET-NX with 6-min TTL
- Release: Atomic Lua compare-and-delete (ownership check)
- Prevents concurrent resume from duplicate webhooks or multiple replicas

## Compensation & Refund Retry

- Steps compensate in reverse order
- Payment compensation: refund if Succeeded, cancel pre-auth if Uncertain + paymentIntentId, no-op otherwise
- Retriable refund failures (GatewayUnavailable/timeout) → `CompensationRefundRetries` table
- `CompensationRefundRetryWorker`: exponential backoff (30s base, 900s max), max 3 retries
- Dedupe: unique filtered index on (OrderId, PaymentId) WHERE Status=Pending

## Outbox Pattern

- Events + outbox message + idempotency record saved in single transaction
- `OutboxProcessor`: polls every 2s, groups by AggregateId (causal ordering), parallel across groups (MaxParallelism=5)
- Max retries: 5, then moved to DeadLetterMessage
- Cleanup: processed messages deleted after 7 days

## Read Model Synchronization

- Separate `ReadDbContext` (denormalized tables: OrderReadModel, B2BOrderReadModel, etc.)
- `KafkaReadModelSynchronizer`: consumes order/return events from Kafka
- `ReadModelEventDispatcher` routes to appropriate updater
- Retry: 3 immediate retries with jitter; systemic failure → pause partition; message-specific → KafkaRetryRecord

## Region Affinity

- `DeterministicWriteRegionOwnershipResolver`: hashes CustomerId → deterministic region
- `CreateOrderCommandHandler` rejects non-owner region with owner hint
- Risk acceptance: ~0.1% duplicate orders possible (handled by compensation)

## Idempotency (3 layers)

1. **API boundary**: IdempotencyKey on CreateOrder → IdempotencyRepository
2. **Saga creation**: Check existing SagaState by correlationId
3. **Saga resume**: Redis distributed lock prevents concurrent webhook processing

## Background Services

| Service | Interval | Purpose |
|---------|----------|---------|
| OutboxProcessor | 2s poll | Publish events to Kafka |
| SagaOrchestrationService | Real-time | Consume order.events, dispatch saga handlers |
| SagaWatchdogService | 1 min | Monitor stuck sagas (>5 min Running), force compensation |
| RecurringOrderSchedulerService | 60s poll | Execute due recurring orders |
| CompensationRefundRetryWorker | 30s poll | Retry failed refunds with exponential backoff |
| KafkaReadModelSynchronizer | Real-time | Sync read models from events |

## Database Schema (AppDbContext + ReadDbContext)

**Write side**: DomainEvents, AggregateSnapshot, OutboxMessage, DeadLetterMessage, SagaState, SagaStepLog, IdempotencyRecord, CompensationRefundRetry, ProcessedEvent, KafkaRetryRecord
**Read side**: OrderReadModel, B2BOrderReadModel, RecurringOrderReadModel, ReturnRequestReadModel, RequestReturnLookup

## Configuration

- Outbox: BatchSize=20, MaxRetries=5, MaxAgeDays=7, PollIntervalMs=2000, MaxParallelism=5
- RecurringOrder: SchedulerIntervalSeconds=60, BatchSize=50
- CompensationRefundRetry: BatchSize=20, MaxRetries=3, PollIntervalSeconds=30, BaseRetryDelaySeconds=30, MaxRetryDelaySeconds=900
- Kafka: BootstrapServers, OrderEventsTopic, ReturnEventsTopic, SagaTopic
- WriteRouting: Enabled, CurrentRegion, Regions list

## Testing

- **Unit**: NUnit + NSubstitute — saga steps, aggregate behavior, command handlers, watchdog transitions
- **Integration**: xUnit + Testcontainers — saga execution + compensation, SagaRepository persistence, read model sync
- **E2E**: Full gRPC + Kafka — happy path + watchdog compensation scenarios

## Key Rules

- **Event sourcing is the source of truth** — never mutate state without raising a domain event
- **Saga timeout is per-saga (5 min total), not per-step** — a slow step starves subsequent ones
- **DeadlineExceeded ≠ failure** — it means Uncertain; wait for webhook/reconciliation to resolve
- **WaitingForEvent sagas must not be killed by watchdog** — verify GetStuckSagasAsync excludes them
- **Outbox guarantees causal ordering within an aggregate** — but parallel across aggregates may reorder within a batch
- **Region affinity is advisory** — duplicates are rare but possible; saga idempotency is the real guard
- **B2B Quote snapshots at 20 events** (not 50) because draft editing creates many events
- **Proto uses `double` for money** — precision loss exists at proto boundary (known issue)
- **String matching on concurrency exceptions is fragile** — known tech debt
